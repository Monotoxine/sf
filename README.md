# Salesforce DX Project: Next Steps

Now that you’ve created a Salesforce DX project, what’s next? Here are some documentation resources to get you started.

## How Do You Plan to Deploy Your Changes?

Do you want to deploy a set of changes, or create a self-contained application? Choose a [development model](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/user-guide/development-models).

## Configure Your Salesforce DX Project

The `sfdx-project.json` file contains useful configuration information for your project. See [Salesforce DX Project Configuration](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_dev.meta/sfdx_dev/sfdx_dev_ws_config.htm) in the _Salesforce DX Developer Guide_ for details about this file.

## Custom LWC Components

This project contains two Lightning Web Components used to maintain affiliate details and their translations.

- **affiliateDataUpdate** – Form to edit affiliate data grouped in tabs with a Translate button that opens the modal.
- **affiliateTranslationModal** – Modal dialog that translates descriptions using the Verto API via Apex.

Both components include basic Jest tests located with each component.
